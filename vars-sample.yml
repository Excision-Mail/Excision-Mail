# Variables information sample file

# Each option has been described in as much detail as possible.
# READ EVERYTHING VERY CLOSELY.

#####-------- REQUIRED SECTION

# This are the domains for which the mail server will be set up.
# NOTE: It is possible to have as many domains as needed in this list.
#       For each domain it is possible to enable/disable NSD separately.
#       It is strongly advised to enable NSD as it does a lot
#       of certificate management, subdomain management and record
#       management for authentication.
#       Seconday DNS overview:
#           https://excision.bsd.ac/guides/secondary/
#       If nsd is not enabled for a domain, it is to be ensured that all
#       records are properly managed manually:
#           https://excision.bsd.ac/guides/manualdns/
domains: 
  - name: <change-me> # e.g. bsd.ac
    nsd: True         # HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, defaults to False if not present
  #- name: domain2.tld
  #  nsd: False
  #- name: domain3.tld3

# The mail_subdomain is what the IP here is going to be called.
# If the mail_subdomain here is put to 'mail', and the first
# domain is called bsd.ac, then the ip here is going to
# resolve to - mail.bsd.ac
# It is generally a good idea to give it informative names - mail, mail1, vmail
# or something similar, to make it clear to the outside world that this
# is an actual server which was set up with mail in mind
# NOTE: the reverse dns lookup should also resolve to whatever
#       mail_subdomain is used: {{ mail_subdomain }}.{{ domains[0].name }}
mail_subdomain: mail

# This is the virtual user that will be created and all server information emails,
# daily reports and outside domain reports will be send to 'admin@domain.tld'
# This is not an actual system user, but an email only user
# NOTE: Excision Mail is configured so that this account can be used as for
#       day-to-day usage, by filterting all emails that are domain related
#       to go into a information-archive email folder. This is very easy to set up
#       using mail filtering via serverside sieve.
admin: <change-me> # e.g. aisha

# public ipv4/ipv6 address of this server 
# We need to get this manually instead of automatically in the case
# that this server is behind a NAT and is only reachable via forwarded ports
ipv4: <change-me> # e.g. 1.2.3.4
ipv6: <change-me> # e.g. dead:beef

#####-------- OPTIONAL SECTION

# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO USE THIS SECTION
#
# It is really recommended to do enable nsd management via Excision Mail
# as configuring NSD manually is really really painful given the horrible
# web interfaces used by service providers.
# In case it is desired to manully manage DNS, the wiki page and the NSD role
# for documentation provide a highly detailed overvie and explain every step 
# of the way. 
# Be aware that configuring DNS manually can take upwards of 7-8 hours, unless
# experienced with DNS setup.
#
# NOTE: These are NOT the same as the ip's of the nameservers of the 
#       DNS hosting provider, such as ns1.dnsmadeeasy.com. These are
#       given by the DNS provider when using a secondary DNS service.
#secondary_nameservers:
#  - ipv4: <change-me> # e.g. 69.65.50.192 # freedns2 (afraid.org)
#  - ipv6: <change-me> # e.g. 2a00:1768:1001:9::31:1 # some cloudns server
#  - ipv4: <change-me> # add as many as desired... :)
#        
# These nameservers are used by users and clients on the web through DNS querying.
# These are the ones that should resolve to pns31.cloudns.net/ns42.dns-provider.tld
# or something of that form, which makes it clear that they are DNS servers.
# Each bullet point is one nameserver with at most one ipv4 and one ipv6
# It is possible to have a nameserver with an ipv4 and no ipv6 (also the other way
# around) but each nameserver should have a proper 'name' (given by the provider)
#public_nameservers:
#  - name: pns31.cloudns.net
#    ipv4: 185.136.96.66
#    ipv6: 2a06:fb00:1::1:66
#  - name: <change-me>
#    ipv4: <change-me>
#    ipv6: <change-me>
#  - name: <change-me>
#    ipv4: <change-me>
#  - name: <change-me>
#    ipv6: <change-me>
